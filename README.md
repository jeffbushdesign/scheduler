# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a React app that lets users book appointments by using a weekly schedule.

Users select the day that they would like to book an appointment and then they will be shown a schedule of existing appointments for that day. Users can add, edit, and delete appointments. A 'spots remaining' counter shows how many appointment slots are left on each day and is updated whenever an appointment is added or removed from the schedule.
